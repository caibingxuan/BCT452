        <p>
            <a>  My name is Gloria, and my Chinese name is Gu Senxin.I am an optimistic and chee
                rful person. I used to work as a website designer in a technology company for two years, where I have a good command of CSS and HTML skills. In my spare time, I will also do some website designs on the Internet, which can not only help me improve my proficiency in the design process, master the methods and ideas of web design, but also put the knowledge points I have learned into practice to improve my practical ability and comprehensive quality. Cultivate and stimulate the sense of innovation.
                My value
                I think honesty is the first standard, we should dare to admit and face mistakes, it is not too late to correct.
